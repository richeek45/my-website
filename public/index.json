[{"content":"Welcome to my blog website.\nI am a software developer. I have lots of interests. I want to learn slowly one thing at a time. I learn things that I don\u0026rsquo;t know and then I try to implement them.\nI have started with frontend (Reactjs). Worked on improving performance in our low resource devices. Then worked on backend in Nodejs with the help of Nestjs framework.\nBuild few independent projects like - video conferencing (2 people) like Google Meet with WebRTC, realtime docs editing with websockets and Yjs(uses CRDTs) and Tiptap editor framework.\nStarted learning Golang. Build a todo-list TUI using bubble tea.\nI have keen interest in databases. Many talented people have spent their lives in developing this black box and giving the illusion of perfection. It is a perfect abstraction that allows us to trust blindly and only interact with the client without second thought. I like to know about the imperfections within it, that is beautifully hidden inside.\nThere are infinite things to learn but very limited time. Given that, I am only willing to invest time in learning things that drives me insane if I don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about it.\n","date":"6 February 2026","permalink":"//localhost:1313/about/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Hi, I’m Richeek Debnath, a software developer who enjoys building things, exploring ideas, and wandering both digitally and physically.\nI write about tech, learning, and whatever catches my curiosity.\n","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Home"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/categories/personal/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Personal"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/tags/experience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Experience"},{"content":"Introduction #This is where I begin my writing in my website, and this is just an example.\nVisit the Hugo website!\n","date":"5 February 2026","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My First Post"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/tags/story/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Story"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"}]
